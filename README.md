# Hello MicroverseðŸš€!

In this project we practice how to set up efficiently a GitHub repo,
create branches, understand the concept of version control, put into practice
GitHub flow, open pull requests, etc. Additionally, we put into action linters
and overall go over the basic structure of a well established project, from implementing
professional documentation to making pull requests.
